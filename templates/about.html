  This site joins "Presidential tweets" and the official events during
  which they were sent.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/conflicts">Conflicts</a> shows tweets that coincided with
    official meetings
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/dates">Dates</a> is the full list of conflicting dates,
    each showing a timeline of tweets and events for that date
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Sources:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Events come
      from <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600daily">whitehouse.gov/1600daily</a>
      and archived versions
      from <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tweets come from <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.
  </ul>
</p>



<p>
  We take the following liberties (I think the point still gets across):
  <ul>
    <li>
      When the whitehouse publishes schedules they don't give meeting
      times, hence no end times. So, the end time of an event is assumed to
      be the start time of the next event minus 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      The last event of the day is synthetically and conservatively
      given a time of one hour, since there is no following
      event. This is usually an underestimate, since this event often
      involves travel (e.g. to an out-of-state golf club or Dave and
      Busters) and takes > 1 hour.
    </li>
  </ul>
  If you don't buy these assumptions, <em>conflicting</em> tweets can
  just be seen as those sent from the President in the middle of a
  week day.
